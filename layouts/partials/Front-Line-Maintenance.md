Front-line maintenance provided by EVO.bg is unique in a very important way: our technicians across Bulgaria are employees of the EVO.bg family. They are trained, equipped, and supported by EVO.bg to exceed industry standards and they share our commitment to developing lifetime clients.

EVO.bg enables carriers and optical equipment providers to the carrier market to focus their resources on their core business and value delivery while ensuring that their critical long haul and regional network assets have experienced, qualified people available to provide optimal response/repair times during events requiring emergency response. Additionally, through scheduled preventative maintenance programs we ensure that our clients' networks are professionally maintained for maximum network availability and optimal service life.

* We also provide cable locate and site access/escort services. Additionally, spares inventory management and reporting, logistics, and return for repair handling are available through 5 sparing depots across Bulgaria.

Our people have been involved with the construction of the majority of the networks across Bulgaria, and in many cases no one knows these routes better than EVO.bg. The EVO.bg team is strategically located across Bulgaria to be within a two hour drive time of the telecommunications networks servicing over 95% of the population in Bulgaria. Our coverage and experience enables us to provide FLM services with very stringent Service Level Agreements across Bulgaria for a number of telecommunication providers and OEMâ€™s.                        

Throughout the past ten years, we have established well-documented processes for handling the logistics associated with FLM dispatches and the ability to have our technicians work under the supervision of our customers NOC/TACs during the resolution of network outage events. EVO.bg owns and operates two 24/7/365 Call Dispatch Centers (in Veliko Tarnovo and Sofia), which are fully redundant and act as the overall control point for the dispatch and coordination of our technicians, spare parts, and test equipment.
